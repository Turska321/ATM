# ATM
This is an atm machine i created for experimenting with user inputs and passwords. There is no save function as i'm not sure how to implement one.
This is a quick little experiment i worked on for ~2 hours (brainstorming included) and it is NOT a complete expertly done software. It is just an MVP (Minimal viable product).
